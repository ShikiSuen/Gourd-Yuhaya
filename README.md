# Gourd-Yuhaya

Recorded Gourdflute instrument samples (played by Yuhaya Wu 吳瑜駿).

We finally decided to make only 24bit-48kHz version available to the public. Reasons:

1. The samples are all originally recorded in 24bit-96kHz. However, frequencies higher than 24kHz are meaningless for storing effective audio information of this instrument.

2. Sample conversions (from 48kHz to 44100Hz) shouldn't bring troublematic performance problems while performing on today's computer hardwares.

We offer instrument formats for Sforzando, Presence XT and Kontakt (at least 5.6.6 R16, not the Kontakt Player but the full version). **All samples are precisely processed with sufficient noise destruction.**

It is fine to use all materials **FOR FREE** from this repository for either commercial or non-commercial **music production purposes only**.

This product is released under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Things need to beware:

- You should not sell these samples to others, because these are not yours.

- If you make these samples into virtual instruments, the virtual instrument must not be sold to others (due to the same reason above). Plus, you must credit that these samples are recorded from Yuhaya Wu 吳瑜駿's performance.

- You may ask for paid services to improve the quality of the virtual instrument you are using (e.g. Kontakt scripting). In such case, you have the responsibility not to leak the virtual instrument file to the public UNLESS the involved programmer(s) treat his/her/their work voluntary.

### Disclaimer regarding accusations of sample abuse

It has recently come to my attention that some concerns have been raised about the originality of my 2017 sampled instrument collection, with suspicions that it may have directly copied samples from Best Service’s Ethno World Hulusi library. I deeply value the trust and support of everyone who has engaged with my work, and I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the creation process behind this project and address these concerns transparently.

Back in 2017, when I set out to create this sampled instrument collection, my goal was to produce a high-quality library inspired by the tonal qualities and character of traditional instruments, including the hulusi. To achieve this, I collaborated with a skilled musician who performed the recordings that form the basis of this collection. During the recording process, we used the Best Service Ethno World Hulusi samples as a reference point. The musician listened to each sample wav file from that library and carefully played each note to match its pitch, articulation, and phrasing as closely as possible. These live performances were then recorded, edited, and processed by me to create the final product.

I want to emphasize that my collection is not a direct copy of the Best Service samples. Every sound in my library was newly performed and recorded in a studio setting. While the Ethno World Hulusi library served as a guide to ensure accuracy and authenticity in the reproduction of the hulusi’s unique sound, the actual audio content in my collection is the result of original performances, not a re-use or re-processing of Best Service’s files.

I understand how the similarity in sound might raise questions, especially given that we deliberately referenced an established and respected library to inform our work. In hindsight, I recognize that I could have been more upfront about this process from the beginning to avoid any confusion. For that, I sincerely apologize. My intention was never to mislead anyone or to take credit for something that wasn’t mine—rather, it was to create a tool that musicians and producers could use, built from genuine effort and collaboration.

Thank you for taking the time to read this explanation. I welcome any questions or feedback you might have as I work to rebuild trust and continue creating with integrity.

### Update History

#### [2017APR24] v1.01

- Using 24bit-48kHz in lieu of 24bit-96kHz to save some disk space occupation from useless frequencies.
- All samples are now precisely tuned (by using a free app called Polyphone, with manual corrections necessary).
- Every sample are now processed with Audacity to make sure all unwanted noises are cleaned.
- Kontakt patch is now made in monolith, due to reduced size of audio files. This won't significantly reduce its loading speed in Kontakt.
